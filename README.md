# 3DOFParallelManipulatorModelling
This project involves designing and modelling of a three degree of freedom planar parallel manipulator
#### Aim 
To design a three degrees of freedom planar parallel manipulator with a cylindrical regular workspace of diameter equal to 100 mm, its height corresponding to the range of rotation of the moving-platform.
## Mechanism and Architecture
For a planar parallel manipulator all the component and motions, including the end effectors generate planar motions. There a several mechanisms for 3DOF PPMs like 3-RRR, 3-RPR, 3-PRR and 3-PPP. For the 3DOF PPM, we have chosen to be 3-RRR where 3 denotes three limbs of the manipulator and R stands for revolute joints. The schematics of the mechanism is shown in Figure 1. As seem in the figure each limb is comprised of three revolute joints out of which the first joint of each limb is actuated. The axis of rotation of all the joints are parallel to each other and are all on the same plane. The workspace of the manipulator is a cylinder with diameter equal to 100 mm.
