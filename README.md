# 3DOFParallelManipulatorModelling
This project involves designing and modelling of a three degree of freedom planar parallel manipulator
### Aim 
To design a three degrees of freedom planar parallel manipulator with a cylindrical regular workspace of diameter equal to 100 mm, its height corresponding to the range of rotation of the moving-platform.
